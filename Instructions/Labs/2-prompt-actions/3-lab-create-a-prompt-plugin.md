# Create a prompt plugin

The prompt builder provides the flexibility to create your own custom prompt by defining input variables that enable incorporating dynamic runtime content within a prompt. It gives you the ability to validate the prompt with Test your prompt, ensuring optimal prompt performance and correctness of the response before integration into your business solutions.

1. Enter a **name** for your prompt.
1. **Write** or **paste** your prompt.
Alternatively, you can build upon an existing template to give yourself a starting point.
1. **Add one or more inputs** to your prompt and provide **sample data**.

1. **Insert** the input you created in the previous step.
In the process of building prompts, makers often need to provide context data to ensure that the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model generates appropriate responses. To facilitate providing context, inputs are used in the prompt, serving as placeholders that get filled with actual data at runtime.
1. Test your prompt using the sample value you provided in step 3 by selecting **Test prompt**.
The testing of prompts is an essential yet often under-emphasized capability. Manual testing is beneficial for iterative building experiences.
1. Save your custom prompt by selecting **Save custom prompt**.

## Review and save your prompt

Prompt builder allows makers to save prompts to facilitate reusability, archiving, and future improvement of prompts.

After you test your prompt with the sample value (in step 5), review it to see how well your prompt works.

When you're satisfied, select **Save custom prompt**.
