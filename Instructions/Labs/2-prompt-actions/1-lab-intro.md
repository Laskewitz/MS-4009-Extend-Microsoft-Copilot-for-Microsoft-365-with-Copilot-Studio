# Introduction

Welcome to the prompt plugins lab. In this lab you will understand what prompts plugins are, how to write good prompt plugins, how to create a prompt plugin for Copilot for Microsoft 365 and finally - how to use it!

## Scenario / Overview / Desired outcomes

Prompts are a way to call a large-language model (LLM), so that you can instruct the LLM to return useful content. You can describe how the LLM should act, what it should and shouldn’t do, and how it should format the response.

Imagine a company with thousands of employees. If everyone would create their own prompts, there would be an overlap in what people would create. To make sure people can reuse prompts created by colleague, there are custom prompts.

You can use prompts for various scenarios, for instance:

- **Classify information** – enter a large text and assign predefined labels to it.
- **Extract entities** – have a large text and extract the client’s name, contact person, or phone number from the text.
- **Draft responses** – a customer has a problem, and you want help with how to respond back to suggest possible solutions.
- **Summarize content** – extract tasks / action items from a text.

These prompts can be use in multiple experiences, for instance in a Power App, a Power Automate cloud flow, in a custom copilot in Copilot Studio or even in Copilot for Microsoft 365. In this lab, you learn about prompt plugins, how you can write good prompt plugins, how you can use the prompt plugins in Copilot for Microsoft 365.
