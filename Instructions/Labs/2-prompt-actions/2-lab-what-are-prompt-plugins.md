# What are prompt plugins?

Custom prompts give makers the freedom to instruct the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model to behave in a certain way or to perform a specific task. By carefully crafting a prompt, you can generate responses that suit your specific business needs. This transforms the GPT model into a flexible tool to accomplish various tasks.

Prompt plugins are automatically available below the Copilot Studio section in the plugin menu in Copilot for Microsoft 365.

## Use specific text for more relevant responses

The goal of prompt engineering is to create an instruction that's as specific as possible to get a more relevant response from the GPT model. Your prompts should be specific to a topic and convey your intent.

A prompt might include the following information:

- The topic
- Keywords or phrases that are associated with the topic
- The tone of the response
- The target audience

If the generated text is too long or contains irrelevant information, adjust the prompt. A good prompt has the following characteristics:

- **Clear and concise**: It's clear and concise language that's easy to understand
- **Specific**: It's specific enough to guide the GPT model in the right direction
- **Contextual**: It provides enough context for the GPT model to generate meaningful output
- **Relevant**: It's relevant to the task and provides the GPT model with enough information to generate meaningful output
